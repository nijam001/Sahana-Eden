# WIF3005 Software Maintenance and Evolution

## Assignment 1: Individual Reengineering Task

---

## Overview

For this assignment, each student will work individually on the selected repository of your group project. You are required to complete one specific reengineering task to improve an assigned component or module of the legacy system, ensuring there is no overlap in contributions with other team members.

---

## Instructions

### 1. Fork the Repository

- Ensure that one of your team members has forked the original legacy system repository.
- Work only in the forked repository, not the original one.

### 2. Select and Confirm Task

- Choose a specific and non-overlapping reengineering task within the assigned component/module.
- Share or discuss a brief task description with your team member for approval (you are encouraged to use Tutorial 6 class time for this).

### 3. Create a New Branch

In the forked repository, you are required to create a new branch using this format:

```
assignment1_<your name>
```

### 4. Perform Individual Reengineering Task

- Implement the agreed-upon improvements in your branch. The task may include:
  - Refactoring
  - Adding documentation
  - Testing
  - Code optimization
- The task may also be coming from what your group has identified in Tutorial 3.

### 5. Create a Pull Request (PR)

- Once the task is done, submit your work as a PR (as done in Tutorial 1)
- Ensure the PR is comparing your branch with the main branch of the forked repository.
- In the PR, include a description (the 5 marks for the assignment will be based on what is reported here).

## PR Description Requirements

The PR description should include:

| Component | Marks | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Addressed Issue** | 1 mark | Describe the issue or problem being addressed |

| **Reengineering Strategy/Approach** | 1.5 marks | Explain the methodology or approach used |
| **Impact of Changes** | 1 mark | Describe the effects and benefits of the changes |
| **Total** | **5 marks** | |

## Submission Instructions

### 7. Submit Your Pull Request

- Once the PR is created with a complete description, submit it.
